# dynabi

WIP Feature proposal for a flexible and zero-cost dynamic stable ABI
for both (runtime loaded and unloadable) dynamically linked
Rust libraries as well as opt-in support for static libraries
and applications to allow for full bidirectional interaction
across library and compiler versions.

"The last ABI you'll ever need"
